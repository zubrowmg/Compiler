//leaving off end of program period.  is it correct?  officially no, but should we compile and simply issue a warning?  i leave that up to you.

PROGRAM grant IS
	global char jake; // [5:10]
	global char ryan;
	global integer zach[1:6];

	procedure if_proc()
		integer declaration;
		integer k;
		begin
			zach := declaration + k;
			
		
	end procedure;

	procedure for_proc()
                integer i;
		begin
			//ryan := jake + i;			
	end procedure;

	begin
		if_proc();
		for_proc();
end program.
