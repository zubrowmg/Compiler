//leaving off end of program period.  is it correct?  officially no, but should we compile and simply issue a warning?  i leave that up to you.

PROGRAM grant IS
	global char jake; // [5:10]
	global char ryan[5:10];
	global integer zach;

	procedure if_proc()
		integer declaration[5:10];
		integer k[6:10];
		begin
			ryan := declaration + k;
			
		
	end procedure;

	procedure for_proc()
                integer i;
		begin
			//ryan := jake + i;			
	end procedure;

	begin
		if_proc();
		for_proc();
end program.
