//leaving off end of program period.  is it correct?  officially no, but should we compile and simply issue a warning?  i leave that up to you.

PROGRAM grant IS
	global char jake; // [5:7]
	global char ryan;
	global integer zach[5:7] ;

	procedure if_proc()
		integer declaration;
		integer k;
		begin
			zach [5] := declaration + k;
			
		
	end procedure;

	procedure for_proc()
                integer i;

			//i := i + i;			
	end procedure;
